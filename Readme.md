# Caffe utilities

Some examples for personal usage, it's not for general purpose but it's easy to modified.

Just put them into caffe/tools and build them.

convert_seq.cpp: convert 1d array in .txt format into lmdb

dump_weights_from_model.cpp: dump model weights into .txt format for further usage.
